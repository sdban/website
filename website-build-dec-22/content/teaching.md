#### Spring 2023


- **Math 247: Linear Algebra I**
  
  We will explore the algebra of matrices, determinants, systems of linear equations, vector spaces, linear transformations, and characteristic value problems.

    *Prerequisites: MATH 122 with C or better or consent.*
    
- **Math 280: Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science** 
 
     This course is an introduction to mathematical concepts central to theoretical computer science, including sets, relations and functions, propositional logic, proof techniques, recurrence relations, graphs and trees, and discrete probability. This course is not intended for students pursuing a degree in mathematics. 

    *Prerequisites: MATH 122 with C or better or consent.*

- **Math 112: College Algebra**
 
     Basic Concepts of algebra, equations and inequalities, functions and graphs, polynomial and rational functions,
  exponential and logarithmic functions, systems of equations and inequalities, matrices and determinants. 
  
  *Prerequisites: Satisfy Placement Table in this section, or MATH 098 with grade of P.*

#### Fall 2022

 - **Math 223: Calculus III** 
  
      We will explore the study of curves and surfaces in three dimensional space. We will introduces the basic methods of
   vector calculus: multi-variable functions, different notions of derivatives of such functions and different notions
   of integrating functions on curves and surfaces. We will introduce Curl, Divergence and Stoke's
   formula. 
   
   *Prerequisites: MATH 122 with C or better, or consent.*


  - **Math 290: Foundations of Mathematics** 
    
    Logic, proof techniques, set theory, relations, functions, cardinality, operations, and an introduction to mathematical structures and number theory.

    *Prerequisites: MATH 122 with C or better or consent.*
  
  
  - **Math 112: College Algebra**
 
     Basic Concepts of algebra, equations and inequalities, functions and graphs, polynomial and rational functions,
  exponential and logarithmic functions, systems of equations and inequalities, matrices and determinants.
