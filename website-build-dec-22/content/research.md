- *Improving Online Rent-or-Buy Algorithms with Sequential Decision Making and ML Predictions* <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/f12a6a7477077af66212ef0813bcf332-Abstract.html" class="card-link\

    <p><small>
    In this work we study online rent-or-buy problems as a sequential decision making problem. We show how one can
    integrate predictions, typically coming from a machine learning (ML) setup, into this framework. Specifically, we
    consider the ski-rental problem and the dynamic TCP acknowledgment problem. We present new online algorithms and
    obtain explicit performance bounds in-terms of the accuracy of the prediction. Our algorithms are close to optimal
    with accurate predictions while hedging against less accurate predictions.

- *Ansatz for $(-1)^{n-1}\nabla p_{n}$.*  Joint with Mahir Can and Adriano Garsia  <a

  <small><p>We construct a special family of equivariant coherent sheaves on the Hilbert scheme on n-points in the
  affine plane. The equivariant Euler characteristic of these sheaves are closely related to the symmetic functions
  $(-1)^{n-1} \nabla p_{n}$. We prove a higher cohomology vanishing result of these sheaves. It follows from the
  Bridgeland-King-Reid correspondence that there is an effective $S_n$ module underlying the aforementioned family of
  symmetric functions.

- *Combinatorial Models for the variety of Complete Quadrics.* Joint with Mahir Can and Mike Joyce <a
  href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02698" class="card-link btn-primary btn-sm" role="button"> Link </a>
                   
  <small><p>We develop several combinatorial models that are useful in the study of the $SL_n$-variety $\mathcal{X}$ of
  complete quadrics. Barred permutations parametrize the fixed points of the action of a maximal torus $T$ of $SL_n$,
  while $\mu$-involutions parametrize the orbits of a Borel subgroup of $SL_n$. Using these combinatorial objects, we
  characterize the $T$-stable curves and surfaces on $\mathcal{X}$, compute the $T$-equivariant $K$-theory of
  $\mathcal{X}$, and describe a Bial&#x337;ynicki-Birula cell decomposition for $\mathcal{X}$. Furthermore, we give a
  computational characterization of the Bruhat order on Borel orbits in $\mathcal{X}$.

- *Equivariant K-theory of smooth projective spherical varieties.* Joint with Mahir Can.  <a
  href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04926" class="card-link btn btn-primary btn-sm" role="button"> Link </a>
  <small><p>We present a description of the equivariant K-theory of a smooth projective spherical variety. This provides an integral K-theory version of Brion's calculation of equivariant Chow-cohomology of such varieties. We consider the equivariant K-theory of wonderful compactifications of minimal rank symmetric varieties. We obtain a formula for their structure constants in terms of certain lower dimensional Schubert classes. This generalizes results of Uma on equivariant compactifications of adjoint groups.

- *Tropical Geometry over Higher Dimensional Local Fields* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5873" class="card-link
  btn-primary btn-sm" role="button"> Link </a>
  <small><p>We introduce the tropicalization of closed subschemes of a torus defined over a higher dimensional local field. We study the basic invariants of such tropicalizations. This is a generalization of the results of Einslieder, Kapranov, Lind, Speyer and Sturmfels to higher local fields.
